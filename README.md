# Book-Database-Search
This project creates a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Python and SQL. Specifically, it uses the Python Tkinter library to create the GUI and it connects to a MySQL database using the Python Connector interface. The GUI allows users to interact with a bookstore database and search for books by Author, Category, and Publisher.

# Features of the Project
Graphical User Interface (GUI): The GUI is organized into three tabs, with each tab corresponding to a specific search method (Author, Category, Publisher). Furthermore, each tab contains a drop-down menu allowing users to view important book information (book title, book price, and book availability by branch). The GUI automatically populates with the relevant data based on the users' selection. \
Data Access Object (DAO): All interactions with the MySQL database are handled by the DAO layer. It implements SQL queries and returns the data to the GUI in the form of Python objects. The DAO layer ensures that the user interface and the database are cleanly separated from one another. This allows for future modifications without interdependencies. <br /> Interface Classes: This project implements custom classes that organize and store the data retrieved from the database. \
User Interaction: Users can interact with the GUI to search for books by author, category, or publisher. The GUI automatically updates all relevant information based on the users' selection. The GUI also handles edge cases (for instance, authors with no books on sale) to ensure that the users only get accurate and relevant data. <br /> <br />
This project integrates Python, TKinter and a MySQL database to great effect. It showcases GUI design, object-oriented programming (OOP), and database connectivity.
